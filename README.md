We are the CoderDojo Bracciano team, a free coding club for girls and boys aged 8 to 17. 

In this video => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a4wEdqZktI , we showcase our robotics project: a smart lamp built using 3D printing, laser cutting, Arduino programming, homemade bioplastic, and ultrasonic sensors. 
Every part was imagined, coded, and assembled by us with creativity, teamwork, and tons of excitement! 
This code and stuff are part of our entry for Coolest Projects 2025, a way to show how technology can be fun, eco-friendly, and made by young minds. 

We hope you enjoy our creation!
